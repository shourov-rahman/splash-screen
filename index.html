    <h1> Coffee </h1>
    <p>
      Coffee cultivation was taken up by many countries in Central America in the
      latter half of the 19th century, and almost all involved the large-scale
      displacement and exploitation of the indigenous people. Harsh conditions
      led to many uprisings, coups, and bloody suppression of peasants.
      <br />
      <br />
      Coffee has become a vital cash crop for many developing countries. Over
      one hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent
      on coffee as their primary source of income. It has become the primary
      export and backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda,
      and Ethiopia, as well as many Central American countries.

      <br />
      <br />
      Coffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the
      seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In
      contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and
      require outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be
      propagated vegetatively.

      <br />
      <br />
      In 2020, the world production of green coffee beans was 175,647,000 60 kg
      bags, led by Brazil with 39% of the total, followed by Vietnam, Colombia,
      and Indonesia.

      <br />
      <br />
      Beans from different countries or regions can usually be distinguished by
      differences in flavor, aroma, body, and acidity.

      <br />
      <br />
      Mycena citricolor, commonly referred to as American Leaf Spot, is a fungus
      that can affect the whole coffee plant. It can grow on leaves, resulting
      in leaves with holes that often fall from the plant. It is a threat
      primarily in Latin America.

      <br />
      <br />
      Mass spraying of insecticides has often proven disastrous, as predators of
      the pests are more sensitive than the pests themselves.

      <br />
      <br />
      Originally, coffee farming was done in the shade of trees that provided a
      habitat for many animals and insects.

      <br />
      <br />
      This method is commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method, or
      "shade-grown". Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their
      production method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows
      under full sun with little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to
      ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the
      clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which
      damage the environment and cause health problems.

      <br />
      <br />
      The American Birding Association, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center,Used
      coffee grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch. They are
      especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving plants such as
      blueberries.

      <br />
      <br />
      Coffee berries are traditionally selectively picked by hand, which is
      labor-intensive as it involves the selection of only the berries at the
      peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries
      are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine.
      After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two types of method—a
      dry process method which is often simpler and less labor-intensive, and a
      wet process method, which incorporates batch fermentation, uses larger
      amounts of water in the process, and often yields a milder coffee.

      <br />
      <br />
      Then they are sorted by ripeness and color, and most often the flesh of
      the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are fermented to
      remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the
      fermentation is finished, the seeds are washed with large quantities of
      fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive
      amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are dried.

      <br />
      <br />
      The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches
      approximately 200 °C (392 °F), though different varieties of seeds differ
      in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.

      <br />
      <br />
      Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear
      entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids
      weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils start to
      develop.

      <br />
      <br />
      Decaffeination of coffee seeds is done while the seeds are still green.
      Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve either
      soaking the green seeds in hot water (often called the "Swiss water
      process")

      <br />
      <br />
      In 1931, a method of packing coffee in a sealed vacuum in cans was
      introduced. The roasted coffee was packed and then 99% of the air was
      removed, allowing the coffee to be stored indefinitely until the can was
      opened. Today this method is in mass use for coffee in a large part of the
      world.

      <br />
      <br />
      Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and Turkish coffee is
      an example of this method. It is prepared by grinding or pounding the
      seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to a boil
      for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a
      μπρίκι : bríki (from Turkish ibrik). This produces a strong coffee with a
      layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for
      drinking) settling at the bottom of the cup.

      <br />
      <br />
      Drip brewers and automatic coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an
      automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that are held
      in a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water
      to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences.
      The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot,
      and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.

      <br />
      <br />
      In a coffee percolator, water is pulled under a pipe by gravity, which is
      then forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by
      boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the process is
      repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal timer,
      or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a
      certain temperature.
